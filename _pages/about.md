It is the greatest challenge to open up the black-box of human brain. My long-term goal is to understand the complexity change of AD brain, especially its structure, connectome. I use integrative neuroimaging and computational modeling methods to explore AD-related patterns and complexity in connectomics, seeking knowledge that will translate into diagnosis/treatment for AD patients by establishing normative trajectories of the conenctome. 

Research summary
======
The human brain is highly dynamic across the lifespan. The emerging network neuroscience framework together with brain imaging techniques (e.g., resting-state fMRI, rfMRI) provide unprecedented opportunities to delineate the dynamics of brain function across the lifespan. In the past decade (2010-2020), my research has mainly focused on the lifespan connectomics of the human brain by using rfMRI to 1) systematically evaluated the test-retest reliability for common measurements in functional connectomics, 2) model lifespan age-related changes of human brain networks, and 3) establish open resources for reproducible brain mapping research. These works are
paving the way for developing neuroimaging biomarkers of both typical and atypical brain development as well as achieving better understanding of neurobiological basis of individual differences in cognition and behavior across the lifespan.

Open resources for reproducible human brain mapping
======
A fundamental challenge for human brain mapping is to develop an efficient, robust, reliable and easy-to-use pipeline to mine big neuroimaging data. I developed a computational Toolkit. [Brant](http://brant.brainnetome.org/), which integrates fMRI data preprocessing, voxel-wise spontaneous activity analysis, functional connectivity analysis, complex network analysis, statistical analysis, data visualization as well as several useful utilities. We designed the toolbox using dynamically generated GUIs, with which other developers can generate their own GUIs by adding a few lines of MATLAB code. Also, to simplify the input process during using BRANT, most functions are initialized with default settings, users will only need to specify several necessary parameters, with free access to all.
